Confidential Information does not include information that falls within the exclusions set out below.”\n",
      "\n",
      "2) Exclusions (standard carve-outs)\n",

      "\n",
      "3) Standard of care\n",
      "“The Receiving Party shall protect Confidential Information with at least the same degree of care it uses to protect its own confidential information, but in no event less than reasonable care.”\n",
      "\n",
      "4) Permitted recipients and use limitation\n",
      "“Receiving Party may use Confidential Information solely to evaluate or negotiate the proposed business relationship and for no other purpose without prior written consent. Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information only to its employees, directors, officers, affiliates, legal counsel, accountants and professional advisors who have a need to know and are bound to protect the information at least as stringently as this Agreement; Receiving Party remains liable for breaches by such persons.”\n",

      "5) Duration and survival\n",
      "“Confidentiality obligations shall continue for [three (3)] years from the date of disclosure, except that Confidential Information that qualifies as a trade secret under applicable law shall remain protected for as long as it remains a trade secret.”\n",
      "\n",
      "6) Return/destruction; certification; archival/backups\n",
      "“Within thirty (30) days after written request or termination of discussions, Receiving Party shall (at Disclosing Party’s option) return or destroy all Confidential Information (including copies and extracts). Receiving Party shall certify in writing within fifteen (15) days that it has complied. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Receiving Party may retain one archival copy in its encrypted, access-controlled backup systems solely for recordkeeping or legal compliance purposes; such retained copy remains subject to the confidentiality obligations hereunder.”\n",

      "7) Compelled disclosure\n",
      "“If Receiving Party is legally compelled to disclose Confidential Information, it shall (to the extent legally permitted) promptly notify Disclosing Party, cooperate in seeking protective measures, and disclose only the portion of Confidential Information legally required.”\n",

      "9) Security and breach notification\n",

If Receiving Party learns of any unauthorized access, use or disclosure of Confidential Information, it shall notify Disclosing Party promptly and take all reasonable steps to mitigate harm.”\n",

      "“Information retained solely in the unaided memory of individuals who have had lawful access to Confidential Information may be used by such individuals without restriction, provided that no physical or electronic copies are retained or used and no deliberate efforts were made to memorize or transcribe Confidential Information. This clause does not reduce or limit Disclosing Party’s right to seek injunctive relief for actual or threatened misuse of trade secrets.”\n",

I'll verify, tighten some points, add any items I think are missing, and give short model-language snippets you can drop into the clause. I’ll flag the highest legal/practical risks first.\\n\\nTop risks (must-fix)\\n- No duration/survival: Leaving the confidentiality term open creates uncertainty and litigation risk. Add a finite term (e.g., 2–5 years) and separate trade-secret survival (for as long as information remains a trade secret).\\n- Vague definitions: “Non-public information” and “strictly confidential” are vague and invite disputes. Define “Confidential Information” and set a measurable standard of care.\\n- Missing standard exclusions: Add the usual carve-outs (public, already known, independently developed, third-party rightfully disclosed) and a compelled-disclosure procedure.\\n- No permitted recipients: The clause prohibits all disclosures but is impractical — permit need-to-know disclosures to employees, advisors, affiliates (bound by confidentiality) and make Recipient liable for their breaches.\\n- No return/destruction timing or certification and no treatment of backups: Require a timeframe and a certificate of destruction, and address archived/backups.\\n- No IP/no-license language: Silence can be interpreted as granting rights. State explicitly that no license or ownership transfer is granted.\\n- No data-security or breach-notification requirement: If the information includes personal or sensitive data, require minimum security measures and prompt breach notice.\\n- No governing law/jurisdiction or remedies: Add law/venue and an injunctive-relief clause (common for confidentiality breaches).\\n\\nSecondary risks / improvements\\n- Oral disclosures: Add requirement that oral disclosures be confirmed in writing within a short period (e.g., 30 days).\\n- Residuals/inevitable disclosure: Consider a residuals clause or an “inevitable disclosure” protection depending on bargaining power and enforceability in your jurisdiction.\\n- Personal data / regulatory compliance: If client lists include personal data, add a compliance/processing clause or reference a Data Processing Agreement.\\n- Ambiguous termination trigger: Define when “termination of discussions” happens.\\n- Export controls, assignment, severability, notice details — add if relevant.\\n\\nRecommended, concise model language snippets\\n(Replace placeholders [X], [Y], [Z] with your choices)\\n\\n1) Definition of Confidential Information\\n“Confidential Information means all non-public information, whether written, oral, electronic or otherwise, disclosed by the Disclosing Party to the Receiving Party, including without limitation technical data, business plans, customer and client lists, pricing, financial information, prototypes, source code and other proprietary information. Confidential Information does not include information that falls within the exclusions set out below.”\\n\\n2) Exclusions (standard carve-outs)\\n“Confidential Information does not include information that: (a) is or becomes publicly available through no breach by the Receiving Party; (b) was already lawfully in the Receiving Party’s possession prior to disclosure, as evidenced by written records; (c) is independently developed by the Receiving Party without use of the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information; or (d) is rightfully received from a third party without restriction on disclosure.”\\n\\n3) Standard of care\\n“The Receiving Party shall protect Confidential Information with at least the same degree of care it uses to protect its own confidential information, but in no event less than reasonable care.”\\n\\n4) Permitted recipients and use limitation\\n“Receiving Party may use Confidential Information solely to evaluate or negotiate the proposed business relationship and for no other purpose without prior written consent. Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information only to its employees, directors, officers, affiliates, legal counsel, accountants and professional advisors who have a need to know and are bound to protect the information at least as stringently as this Agreement; Receiving Party remains liable for breaches by such persons.”\\n\\n5) Duration and survival\\n“Confidentiality obligations shall continue for [three (3)] years from the date of disclosure, except that Confidential Information that qualifies as a trade secret under applicable law shall remain protected for as long as it remains a trade secret.”\\n\\n6) Return/destruction; certification; archival/backups\\n“Within thirty (30) days after written request or termination of discussions, Receiving Party shall (at Disclosing Party’s option) return or destroy all Confidential Information (including copies and extracts).

No compliance obligations or cross-border transfer safeguards.\\n  - Fix: Add language requiring compliance with applicable privacy laws, and specify permitted transfers, data processing roles, and responsibilities (or a separate DPA).\\n\\n- No residuals/inevitable disclosure protection or carve-out\\n  - Risk: Plain “no-use” may conflict with employment mobility / residual knowledge rules; also, extreme restrictions could be unenforceable.\\n  - Fix: Consider a residuals clause (e.g., non-attribution of general knowledge retained in unaided memory) or specific protection for trade-secret claims and injunctive relief for inevitable disclosure.\\n\\nOther practical suggestions\\n- Add definitions for “Disclosing Party” and “Receiving Party” and the effective date.\\n- Clarify when “termination of discussions” occurs (mutual written notice, after X days of inactivity, or execution/termination of a definitive agreement).\\n- Consider including a severability clause and assignment restrictions.\\n- If sensitive technical data subject to export controls, add export-control compliance obligations.\\n\\nIf you want, I can:\\n- Draft a revised NDA confidentiality clause that incorporates these fixes, or\\n- Produce short model language snippets for any of the specific fixes above (e.g., compelled disclosure, return/destruction certification, permitted recipients).',\n",
