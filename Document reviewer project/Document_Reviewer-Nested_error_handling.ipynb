      "\n",
      "High-priority risks (most likely to cause immediate legal/exposure problems)\n",
      "- Overly broad definition: “all non-public information”\n",
      "  - Risk: Captures virtually anything non-public, including information not intended to be confidential (e.g., trivial operational facts). Increases litigation risk and compliance burden.\n",
      "  - Fix: Narrow the definition and add express carve-outs (prior knowledge, independently developed, rightfully received from third party). Example: “Confidential Information means information disclosed by the Disclosing Party that is designated as confidential or that, under the circumstances, ought reasonably to be understood to be confidential, excluding information that (a) was already known to the Receiving Party without restriction, (b) is independently developed by the Receiving Party without reference to the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information, or (c) was lawfully received from a third party without restriction.”\n",
      "\n",
      "- No permitted disclosures to employees/affiliates/advisors\n",
      "  - Risk: Practical problem — Receiving Party typically needs to show information to employees, contractors, legal/financial advisors. A total ban is impractical and could prevent evaluation.\n",
      "  - Fix: Allow disclosures on a need-to-know basis provided recipients are under confidentiality obligations. Example: “Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information to its employees, contractors and professional advisors who have a legitimate need to know, provided such persons are bound by confidentiality obligations at least as protective as this Agreement.”\n",
      "\n",
      "- No compelled-disclosure / legal-process carve-out or notification requirement\n",
      "  - Risk: Receiving Party might be exposed to liability for failing to comply with subpoenas, or Disclosing Party may be surprised by compelled disclosures.\n",
      "  - Fix: Add a compelled disclosure procedure requiring prompt notice and cooperation to seek protective order. Example: “If Receiving Party is legally compelled to disclose Confidential Information, it will promptly notify Disclosing Party and cooperate in any reasonable effort to obtain a protective order; only the minimum required information may be disclosed.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Medium-priority risks\n",
      "- No duration/term of confidentiality\n",
      "  - Risk: Could be interpreted as indefinite — problematic for Receiving Party; also unclear for Disclosing Party protection goals.\n",
      "  - Fix: State an explicit duration (e.g., 2–5 years) except for trade secrets which remain protected as long as they qualify. Example: “The confidentiality obligations will continue for [X] years from disclosure, except for trade secrets which shall remain protected for so long as they remain trade secrets under applicable law.”\n",
      "\n",
      "- No standard of care for protecting Confidential Information\n",
      "  - Risk: “Strictly confidential” is vague. Does Receiving Party need to use reasonable care? Higher-than-reasonable standard may be unworkable.\n",
      "  - Fix: Specify standard (e.g., same degree of care as for its own confidential info, but no less than reasonable care). Example: “Receiving Party shall protect Confidential Information using the same degree of care it uses to protect its own confidential information, but no less than a reasonable degree of care.”\n",
      "\n",
      "- No exclusions for information known publicly through Receiving Party’s fault or partial disclosures\n",
      "  - Risk: “Publicly known through no fault of the Receiving Party” is subjective and may be contested.\n",
      "  - Fix: Clarify public-domain carve-out and how to treat partial disclosure. Example: include explicit language that public-domain status must be demonstrable and that partial public disclosure does not negate confidentiality of remaining portions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lower-priority but useful additions\n",
      "- Return/destruction procedure and certification\n",
      "  - Risk: No time limit or mechanism; disputes may arise over retained copies/backups.\n",
      "  - Fix: Add timeline and requirement to certify destruction/return, and carve-out for archival backups. Example: “Within 30 days of termination, Receiving Party will return or securely destroy all Confidential Information and certify in writing; Receiving Party may retain copies only to the extent required by law or for archival backup, provided such copies remain subject to the Agreement.”\n",
      "\n",
      "- Residuals / memory carve-out\n",
      "  - Risk: Without residuals clause, incidental memory of ideas could be actionable.\n",
      "  - Fix: Add a residuals clause limiting liability for unintentional retention in unaided memory. Example: “No liability for residuals — Receiving Party may use general knowledge retained in unaided memory provided it does not consciously recall or use specific Confidential Information.”\n",
      "\n",
      "- No remedies / injunctive relief\n",
      "  - Risk: Disclosing Party may need injunctive relief for breaches but no mention provided; conversely, Receiving Party may prefer limitations on remedies.\n",
      "  - Fix: Specify injunctive relief availability and any caps on damages if desired by Receiving Party. Example: “The parties agree that breach may cause irreparable harm and that Disclosing Party is entitled to injunctive relief in addition to other remedies.”\n",
      "\n",
      "- No governing law / jurisdiction\n",
      "  - Risk: Uncertainty around dispute resolution.\n",
      "  - Fix: Add governing law and venue or arbitration clause.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other practical notes\n",
      "- Marking/identification of confidential disclosures (written vs. oral)\n",

      "\n",
      "2) No permitted disclosures to employees/affiliates/advisors\n",

For each risk I include a brief explanation and suggested wording or fixes you can propose.\\n\\nHigh-priority risks (most likely to cause immediate legal/exposure problems)\\n- Overly broad definition: “all non-public information”\\n  - Risk: Captures virtually anything non-public, including information not intended to be confidential (e.g., trivial operational facts). Increases litigation risk and compliance burden.\\n  - Fix: Narrow the definition and add express carve-outs (prior knowledge, independently developed, rightfully received from third party). Example: “Confidential Information means information disclosed by the Disclosing Party that is designated as confidential or that, under the circumstances, ought reasonably to be understood to be confidential, excluding information that (a) was already known to the Receiving Party without restriction, (b) is independently developed by the Receiving Party without reference to the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information, or (c) was lawfully received from a third party without restriction.”\\n\\n- No permitted disclosures to employees/affiliates/advisors\\n  - Risk: Practical problem — Receiving Party typically needs to show information to employees, contractors, legal/financial advisors. A total ban is impractical and could prevent evaluation.\\n  - Fix: Allow disclosures on a need-to-know basis provided recipients are under confidentiality obligations. Example: “Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information to its employees, contractors and professional advisors who have a legitimate need to know, provided such persons are bound by confidentiality obligations at least as protective as this Agreement.”\\n\\n- No compelled-disclosure / legal-process carve-out or notification requirement\\n  - Risk: Receiving Party might be exposed to liability for failing to comply with subpoenas, or Disclosing Party may be surprised by compelled disclosures.\\n  - Fix: Add a compelled disclosure procedure requiring prompt notice and cooperation to seek protective order. Example: “If Receiving Party is legally compelled to disclose Confidential Information, it will promptly notify Disclosing Party and cooperate in any reasonable effort to obtain a protective order; only the minimum required information may be disclosed.”\\n\\nMedium-priority risks\\n- No duration/term of confidentiality\\n  - Risk: Could be interpreted as indefinite — problematic for Receiving Party; also unclear for Disclosing Party protection goals.\\n  - Fix: State an explicit duration (e.g., 2–5 years) except for trade secrets which remain protected as long as they qualify. Example: “The confidentiality obligations will continue for [X] years from disclosure, except for trade secrets which shall remain protected for so long as they remain trade secrets under applicable law.”\\n\\n- No standard of care for protecting Confidential Information\\n  - Risk: “Strictly confidential” is vague. Does Receiving Party need to use reasonable care?

This includes technical data, business plans, and client lists.     The Receiving Party shall not disclose, publish, or use this information for any purpose other than evaluating the proposed business relationship without prior written consent.     This obligation does not apply to information that is publicly known through no fault of the Receiving Party.     Upon termination of discussions, the Receiving Party shall return or destroy all confidential materials.\\nContext: \\n0\\n1\\nExtracted key clauses:\\n\\n- Definition / Scope of Confidential Information\\n  - \"all non-public information received from the Disclosing Party\" — examples: \"technical data, business plans, and client lists.\"\\n\\n- Confidentiality obligation\\n  - \"The Receiving Party agrees to treat all non-public information ... as strictly confidential.\"\\n  - Prohibition: \"shall not disclose, publish, or use this information for any purpose other than evaluating the proposed business relationship.\"\\n\\n- Purpose limitation\\n  - Use restricted to \"evaluating the proposed business relationship.\"\\n\\n- Prior written consent requirement\\n  - Any use or disclosure outside the permitted purpose requires \"prior written consent.\"\\n\\n- Exclusions (public information)\\n  - Exception: obligation \"does not apply to information that is publicly known through no fault of the Receiving Party.\"\\n\\n- Return / Destruction on termination\\n  - \"Upon termination of discussions, the Receiving Party shall return or destroy all confidential materials.\"\\n\\nOptional note (not an extracted clause): No explicit confidentiality duration or remedies for breach are stated beyond the return/destruction requirement.\\nI reviewed the NDA excerpt and extracted clauses. Below I flag legal risks, ambiguities, and missing protections that could cause disputes or harm a party. For each risk I include a brief explanation and suggested wording or fixes you can propose.\\n\\nHigh-priority risks (most likely to cause immediate legal/exposure problems)\\n- Overly broad definition: “all non-public information”\\n  - Risk: Captures virtually anything non-public, including information not intended to be confidential (e.g., trivial operational facts). Increases litigation risk and compliance burden.\\n  - Fix: Narrow the definition and add express carve-outs (prior knowledge, independently developed, rightfully received from third party). Example: “Confidential Information means information disclosed by the Disclosing Party that is designated as confidential or that, under the circumstances, ought reasonably to be understood to be confidential, excluding information that (a) was already known to the Receiving Party without restriction, (b) is independently developed by the Receiving Party without reference to the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information, or (c) was lawfully received from a third party without restriction.”\\n\\n- No permitted disclosures to employees/affiliates/advisors\\n  - Risk: Practical problem — Receiving Party typically needs to show information to employees, contractors, legal/financial advisors. A total ban is impractical and could prevent evaluation.\\n  - Fix: Allow disclosures on a need-to-know basis provided recipients are under confidentiality obligations. Example: “Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information to its employees, contractors and professional advisors who have a legitimate need to know, provided such persons are bound by confidentiality obligations at least as protective as this Agreement.”\\n\\n- No compelled-disclosure / legal-process carve-out or notification requirement\\n  - Risk: Receiving Party might be exposed to liability for failing to comply with subpoenas, or Disclosing Party may be surprised by compelled disclosures.\\n  - Fix: Add a compelled disclosure procedure requiring prompt notice and cooperation to seek protective order. Example: “If Receiving Party is legally compelled to disclose Confidential Information, it will promptly notify Disclosing Party and cooperate in any reasonable effort to obtain a protective order; only the minimum required information may be disclosed.”\\n\\nMedium-priority risks\\n- No duration/term of confidentiality\\n  - Risk: Could be interpreted as indefinite — problematic for Receiving Party; also unclear for Disclosing Party protection goals.\\n  - Fix: State an explicit duration (e.g., 2–5 years) except for trade secrets which remain protected as long as they qualify. Example: “The confidentiality obligations will continue for [X] years from disclosure, except for trade secrets which shall remain protected for so long as they remain trade secrets under applicable law.”\\n\\n- No standard of care for protecting Confidential Information\\n  - Risk: “Strictly confidential” is vague. Does Receiving Party need to use reasonable care? Higher-than-reasonable standard may be unworkable.\\n  - Fix: Specify standard (e.g., same degree of care as for its own confidential info, but no less than reasonable care). Example: “Receiving Party shall protect Confidential Information using the same degree of care it uses to protect its own confidential information, but no less than a reasonable degree of care.”\\n\\n- No exclusions for information known publicly through Receiving Party’s fault or partial disclosures\\n  - Risk: “Publicly known through no fault of the Receiving Party” is subjective and may be contested.\\n  - Fix: Clarify public-domain carve-out and how to treat partial disclosure.

Confidential Information expressly includes, without limitation, technical data, business plans, financial information and client lists, but excludes information that the Receiving Party can demonstrate: (a) was already known to the Receiving Party without restriction at the time of disclosure; (b) is or becomes publicly available through no breach of this Agreement by the Receiving Party; (c) is rightfully received from a third party without restriction; or (d) is independently developed by the Receiving Party without use of or reference to the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information.”\\n\\n2) No permitted disclosures to employees/affiliates/advisors\\n - Risk: Prevents practical evaluation and obliges Receiving Party to violate the NDA to perform normal activities.\\n - Fix (sample clause):\\n   “Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information only to its employees, contractors, affiliates and professional advisors who have a legitimate need to know for the Purpose, provided such persons are bound by confidentiality obligations at least as protective as this Agreement.

Oral disclosures are Confidential if identified as confidential at disclosure and confirmed in writing within 30 days.”\\n\\n12) Representations/warranties about right to disclose\\n - Optional but useful for Receiving Party:\\n   “Disclosing Party represents that, to its knowledge, it has the right to disclose the Confidential Information and that such disclosure does not breach any agreement with third parties.”\\n\\n13) Assignment, successors, and severability\\n - Fix (sample clauses):\\n   “This Agreement is binding upon and inures to the benefit of the parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.
