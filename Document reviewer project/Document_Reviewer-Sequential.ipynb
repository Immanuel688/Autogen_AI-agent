      "\n",
      "Summary\n",
      "- The clause broadly requires the Receiving Party to treat all non-public information as “strictly confidential,” limits use to evaluation of a proposed business relationship, prohibits disclosure without prior written consent, except for information “publicly known through no fault” of the Receiving Party, and requires return or destruction of confidential materials on termination of discussions.\n",
      "- I flagged multiple legal and compliance risks, ambiguities, and missing protections that could create disputes, regulatory exposure, or operational problems.\n",
      "\n",
      "Flagged risks / issues and why they matter (with suggested fixes)\n",
      "\n",
      "1) Undefined terms and scope (Risk: high)\n",
      "- Problem: Terms like “non-public information,” “strictly confidential,” “Disclosing Party,” “Receiving Party,” and “termination of discussions” are not precisely defined.\n",
      "- Why: Ambiguity increases litigation risk and differing interpretations.\n",
      "- Fix: Define terms explicitly. Specify whether “non-public information” includes oral, electronic, or derivative information; and what “termination” means (date/trigger).\n",
      "\n",
      "2) No confidentiality duration or survival clause (Risk: high)\n",
      "- Problem: No fixed duration after termination; only mentions obligation “during discussions” and return/destroy upon termination.\n",
      "- Why: Parties need certainty (e.g., trade secrets often survive indefinitely; commercial info usually 3–5 years).\n",
      "- Fix: Add a confidentiality period (e.g., 3–5 years) for general confidential info and state trade-secrets survive indefinitely or as permitted by law.\n",
      "\n",
      "3) Missing carve-outs for independent development, prior possession, and third-party sources (Risk: high)\n",
      "- Problem: No explicit exceptions for information (a) already in Receiving Party’s possession; (b) independently developed; (c) lawfully received from a third party.\n",
      "- Why: Without these, Receiving Party may be unfairly restricted or exposed to breach claims.\n",
      "- Fix: Add standard exceptions: prior possession (with proof), independent development, lawful third-party disclosure, and information in the public domain (clarify “without fault”).\n",
      "\n",
      "4) Compelled disclosure / legal process exception (Risk: high)\n",
      "- Problem: No procedure for subpoenas/regulatory demands.\n",
      "- Why: Receiving Party may be put in impossible position if served with legal demand.\n",
      "- Fix: Add clause requiring prompt notice to Disclosing Party, cooperation, and allow disclosure to the extent legally required, with efforts to obtain protective order.\n",
      "\n",
      "5) No permitted disclosures to employees, affiliates, advisors, or contractors (Risk: medium-high)\n",
      "- Problem: Practical business use often requires sharing with personnel and professional advisors.\n",
      "- Why: Restrictive language could block reasonable internal sharing or create compliance issues.\n",
      "- Fix: Permit disclosures to those with a need-to-know who are bound by confidentiality obligations; include responsibility for their breaches.\n",
      "\n",
      "6) No statement re: retention of backup copies or systems (Risk: medium)\n",
      "- Problem: Demanding “return or destroy all confidential materials” may be impractical for backups/logs.\n",
      "- Why: Business continuity and legal hold obligations may require retention.\n",
      "- Fix: Allow retention of archival/backups that cannot reasonably be destroyed, but require they remain confidential and be destroyed when feasible. Provide for certification of destruction where practical.\n",
      "\n",
      "7) No certification or audit right for destruction (Risk: low-medium)\n",
      "- Problem: Disclosing Party has no mechanism to verify destruction.\n",
      "- Why: May limit confidence in compliance.\n",
      "- Fix: Allow Disclosing Party to request certification of destruction within a defined timeframe; optionally permit limited audits.\n",
      "\n",
      "8) No security, data-protection, or privacy controls (Risk: medium-high if data is personal)\n",
      "- Problem: No obligations for technical or organizational measures or data processing terms.\n",
      "- Why: If confidential includes personal data, laws like GDPR, CCPA require specific protections and DPA terms.\n",
      "- Fix: Add security obligations (e.g., reasonable industry-standard safeguards), data processing and breach notification provisions, and require compliance with applicable privacy laws.\n",
      "\n",
      "9) Export control and regulatory compliance not addressed (Risk: medium)\n",
      "- Problem: “Technical data” may be subject to export controls or sanctions.\n",
      "- Why: Non-compliance can cause criminal/regulatory penalties.\n",
      "- Fix: Add compliance covenant for export controls and sanctions laws; require parties to identify restricted data up front.\n",
      "\n",
      "10) No remedies / injunctive relief clause (Risk: medium)\n",
      "- Problem: No statement that injunctive relief may be sought for breach.\n",
      "- Why: Confidentiality breaches often require urgent injunctive relief; absence may hinder enforcement.\n",
      "- Fix: Include a provision that monetary damages are inadequate and injunctive relief is available.\n",
      "\n",
      "11) No limitation of liability / indemnity language (Risk: medium)\n",
      "- Problem: No allocation of liability for breaches or misuse.\n",
      "- Why: Parties may want caps or indemnities; absent these, uncertainty remains.\n",
      "- Fix: Add appropriate indemnity and limitation-of-liability clauses as negotiated.\n",
      "\n",
      "12) Potential personal data / privacy issues (Risk: medium-high)\n",
      "- Problem: Client lists could contain personal data; no DPA, processor/ controller allocation, lawful basis, or cross-border transfer rules.\n",
      "- Why: Data privacy laws require specific obligations and rights for data subjects.\n",
      "- Fix: Add a Data Processing Agreement or privacy-specific clauses: purpose limitation, legal basis, data subject rights, breach notification timelines, data transfers, and security measures.\n",
      "\n",
      "13) Lack of timeframes and procedures for return/destroy (Risk: low-medium)\n",
      "- Problem: No timeframe for when return/destruction must occur after termination; no mechanism for certification.\n",
      "- Why: Creates disagreement over compliance timing.\n",
      "- Fix: Specify a reasonable period (e.g., within 30 days of termination) and allow certification.\n",
      "\n",
      "14) Residuals / “memory” carve-out not addressed (Risk: low-medium)\n",
      "- Problem: No residuals clause to permit use of information retained in unaided memory.\n",
      "- Why: Without it, employees may be unfairly restricted in later roles.\n",
      "- Fix: Add a residuals clause carefully limited to unaided memory, not copying documents or deliberate retention.\n",
      "\n",
      "Practical suggested language snippets (short, can be adapted by counsel)\n",
      "- Definitions: “Confidential Information means non-public information disclosed… expressly designated as confidential or which a reasonable person would understand to be confidential… excludes information that: (a) was known to Receiving Party prior to disclosure (with written evidence); (b) is or becomes public without breach…; (c) is received lawfully from a third party; (d) is independently developed without use of Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information.”\n",
      "- Duration: “Confidentiality obligations shall continue for [three (3) years] from the date of disclosure, except that trade secrets shall be protected for as long as they qualify as trade secrets under applicable law.”\n",
      "- Permitted disclosures: “Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information to its employees, affiliates, legal and financial advisors and contractors on a need-to-know basis, provided such persons are bound by obligations at least as protective as this Agreement.”\n",
      "- Compelled disclosure: “If Receiving Party is required by law to disclose Confidential Information, it shall promptly notify Disclosing Party and cooperate to seek a protective order; only disclose that portion legally required.”\n",
      "- Return/destruction: “Within 30 days of termination, Receiving Party shall return or destroy Confidential Information and, upon Disclosing Party’s request, certify in writing the destruction. Archival backup copies may be retained only as required by business continuity or legal obligations and shall remain subject to confidentiality.”\n",
      "- Data protection: “If Confidential Information includes personal data, parties shall enter into a Data Processing Addendum and comply with applicable data protection laws; Receiving Party shall implement appropriate technical and organizational measures.”\n",
      "- Injunctive relief: “Breach of confidentiality may cause irreparable harm; Disclosing Party is entitled to injunctive relief in addition to other remedies.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Actionable next steps\n",
      "- Decide which side you represent (Disclosing or Receiving) so language can be tailored to protect that party.\n",
      "- Add the missing clauses above to the agreement. For personal data or cross-border transfers, include a DPA.\n",
      "- Have counsel review and finalize the wording and any jurisdiction-specific requirements (this is not legal advice).\n",
      "\n",
      "If you’d like, I can:\n",
      "- Produce a redlined version of the clause incorporating the fixes above, or\n",
      "- Generate full clause text tailored for either Disclosing Party or Receiving Party.\n",

      "    This obligation does not apply to information that is publicly known through no fault of the Receiving Party.\n",
      "    Upon termination of discussions, the Receiving Party shall return or destroy all confidential materials.\n",

      "Here are the key clauses extracted from the provided text:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Confidentiality obligation\n",
      "  - Receiving Party must treat all non-public information from the Disclosing Party as strictly confidential.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Definition / examples of Confidential Information\n",
      "  - Includes technical data, business plans, and client lists (i.e., non-public information).\n",
      "\n",
      "- Use limitation\n",
      "  - Confidential information may only be used to evaluate the proposed business relationship.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Disclosure prohibition and consent requirement\n",
      "  - Receiving Party shall not disclose, publish, or use the information for any purpose other than evaluation without prior written consent.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Exceptions to confidentiality\n",
      "  - Does not apply to information that is publicly known through no fault of the Receiving Party.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Return or destruction on termination\n",
      "  - Upon termination of discussions, Receiving Party shall return or destroy all confidential materials.\n",
      "\n",
      "Optional observation (not a clause): The text does not specify a separate fixed confidentiality duration beyond the obligation during discussions and the return/destroy requirement upon termination.\n",
      "Summary\n",
      "- The clause broadly requires the Receiving Party to treat all non-public information as “strictly confidential,” limits use to evaluation of a proposed business relationship, prohibits disclosure without prior written consent, except for information “publicly known through no fault” of the Receiving Party, and requires return or destruction of confidential materials on termination of discussions.\n",
      "- I flagged multiple legal and compliance risks, ambiguities, and missing protections that could create disputes, regulatory exposure, or operational problems.\n",
      "\n",
      "Flagged risks / issues and why they matter (with suggested fixes)\n",
      "\n",
      "1) Undefined terms and scope (Risk: high)\n",
      "- Problem: Terms like “non-public information,” “strictly confidential,” “Disclosing Party,” “Receiving Party,” and “termination of discussions” are not precisely defined.\n",
      "- Why: Ambiguity increases litigation risk and differing interpretations.\n",
      "- Fix: Define terms explicitly. Specify whether “non-public information” includes oral, electronic, or derivative information; and what “termination” means (date/trigger).\n",
      "\n",
      "2) No confidentiality duration or survival clause (Risk: high)\n",
      "- Problem: No fixed duration after termination; only mentions obligation “during discussions” and return/destroy upon termination.\n",
      "- Why: Parties need certainty (e.g., trade secrets often survive indefinitely; commercial info usually 3–5 years).\n",
      "- Fix: Add a confidentiality period (e.g., 3–5 years) for general confidential info and state trade-secrets survive indefinitely or as permitted by law.\n",
      "\n",
      "3) Missing carve-outs for independent development, prior possession, and third-party sources (Risk: high)\n",
      "- Problem: No explicit exceptions for information (a) already in Receiving Party’s possession; (b) independently developed; (c) lawfully received from a third party.\n",
      "- Why: Without these, Receiving Party may be unfairly restricted or exposed to breach claims.\n",
      "- Fix: Add standard exceptions: prior possession (with proof), independent development, lawful third-party disclosure, and information in the public domain (clarify “without fault”).\n",
      "\n",
      "4) Compelled disclosure / legal process exception (Risk: high)\n",
      "- Problem: No procedure for subpoenas/regulatory demands.\n",
      "- Why: Receiving Party may be put in impossible position if served with legal demand.\n",
      "- Fix: Add clause requiring prompt notice to Disclosing Party, cooperation, and allow disclosure to the extent legally required, with efforts to obtain protective order.\n",
      "\n",
      "5) No permitted disclosures to employees, affiliates, advisors, or contractors (Risk: medium-high)\n",
      "- Problem: Practical business use often requires sharing with personnel and professional advisors.\n",
      "- Why: Restrictive language could block reasonable internal sharing or create compliance issues.\n",
      "- Fix: Permit disclosures to those with a need-to-know who are bound by confidentiality obligations; include responsibility for their breaches.\n",
      "\n",
      "6) No statement re: retention of backup copies or systems (Risk: medium)\n",
      "- Problem: Demanding “return or destroy all confidential materials” may be impractical for backups/logs.\n",
      "- Why: Business continuity and legal hold obligations may require retention.\n",
      "- Fix: Allow retention of archival/backups that cannot reasonably be destroyed, but require they remain confidential and be destroyed when feasible. Provide for certification of destruction where practical.\n",
      "\n",
      "7) No certification or audit right for destruction (Risk: low-medium)\n",
      "- Problem: Disclosing Party has no mechanism to verify destruction.\n",
      "- Why: May limit confidence in compliance.\n",
      "- Fix: Allow Disclosing Party to request certification of destruction within a defined timeframe; optionally permit limited audits.\n",
      "\n",
      "8) No security, data-protection, or privacy controls (Risk: medium-high if data is personal)\n",
      "- Problem: No obligations for technical or organizational measures or data processing terms.\n",
      "- Why: If confidential includes personal data, laws like GDPR, CCPA require specific protections and DPA terms.\n",
      "- Fix: Add security obligations (e.g., reasonable industry-standard safeguards), data processing and breach notification provisions, and require compliance with applicable privacy laws.\n",
      "\n",
      "9) Export control and regulatory compliance not addressed (Risk: medium)\n",
      "- Problem: “Technical data” may be subject to export controls or sanctions.\n",
      "- Why: Non-compliance can cause criminal/regulatory penalties.\n",
      "- Fix: Add compliance covenant for export controls and sanctions laws; require parties to identify restricted data up front.\n",
      "\n",
      "10) No remedies / injunctive relief clause (Risk: medium)\n",
      "- Problem: No statement that injunctive relief may be sought for breach.\n",
      "- Why: Confidentiality breaches often require urgent injunctive relief; absence may hinder enforcement.\n",
      "- Fix: Include a provision that monetary damages are inadequate and injunctive relief is available.\n",
      "\n",
      "11) No limitation of liability / indemnity language (Risk: medium)\n",
      "- Problem: No allocation of liability for breaches or misuse.\n",
      "- Why: Parties may want caps or indemnities; absent these, uncertainty remains.\n",
      "- Fix: Add appropriate indemnity and limitation-of-liability clauses as negotiated.\n",
      "\n",
      "12) Potential personal data / privacy issues (Risk: medium-high)\n",
      "- Problem: Client lists could contain personal data; no DPA, processor/ controller allocation, lawful basis, or cross-border transfer rules.\n",
      "- Why: Data privacy laws require specific obligations and rights for data subjects.\n",
      "- Fix: Add a Data Processing Agreement or privacy-specific clauses: purpose limitation, legal basis, data subject rights, breach notification timelines, data transfers, and security measures.\n",
      "\n",
      "13) Lack of timeframes and procedures for return/destroy (Risk: low-medium)\n",
      "- Problem: No timeframe for when return/destruction must occur after termination; no mechanism for certification.\n",
      "- Why: Creates disagreement over compliance timing.\n",
      "- Fix: Specify a reasonable period (e.g., within 30 days of termination) and allow certification.\n",
      "\n",
      "14) Residuals / “memory” carve-out not addressed (Risk: low-medium)\n",
      "- Problem: No residuals clause to permit use of information retained in unaided memory.\n",
      "- Why: Without it, employees may be unfairly restricted in later roles.\n",
      "- Fix: Add a residuals clause carefully limited to unaided memory, not copying documents or deliberate retention.\n",
      "\n",
      "Practical suggested language snippets (short, can be adapted by counsel)\n",
      "- Definitions: “Confidential Information means non-public information disclosed… expressly designated as confidential or which a reasonable person would understand to be confidential… excludes information that: (a) was known to Receiving Party prior to disclosure (with written evidence); (b) is or becomes public without breach…; (c) is received lawfully from a third party; (d) is independently developed without use of Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information.”\n",
      "- Duration: “Confidentiality obligations shall continue for [three (3) years] from the date of disclosure, except that trade secrets shall be protected for as long as they qualify as trade secrets under applicable law.”\n",
      "- Permitted disclosures: “Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information to its employees, affiliates, legal and financial advisors and contractors on a need-to-know basis, provided such persons are bound by obligations at least as protective as this Agreement.”\n",
      "- Compelled disclosure: “If Receiving Party is required by law to disclose Confidential Information, it shall promptly notify Disclosing Party and cooperate to seek a protective order; only disclose that portion legally required.”\n",
      "- Return/destruction: “Within 30 days of termination, Receiving Party shall return or destroy Confidential Information and, upon Disclosing Party’s request, certify in writing the destruction. Archival backup copies may be retained only as required by business continuity or legal obligations and shall remain subject to confidentiality.”\n",
      "- Data protection: “If Confidential Information includes personal data, parties shall enter into a Data Processing Addendum and comply with applicable data protection laws; Receiving Party shall implement appropriate technical and organizational measures.”\n",
      "- Injunctive relief: “Breach of confidentiality may cause irreparable harm; Disclosing Party is entitled to injunctive relief in addition to other remedies.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Actionable next steps\n",
      "- Decide which side you represent (Disclosing or Receiving) so language can be tailored to protect that party.\n",
      "- Add the missing clauses above to the agreement. For personal data or cross-border transfers, include a DPA.\n",
      "- Have counsel review and finalize the wording and any jurisdiction-specific requirements (this is not legal advice).\n",

      "Summary judgment\n",
      "- The provided clause captures basic confidentiality duties but omits several common, high-risk protections and clarifications needed to make it workable and defensible.\n",
      "- Major risks: undefined terms and scope, no fixed duration/survival, missing common exceptions (prior possession, independent development, third‑party sources), no compelled‑disclosure procedure, no permitted recipient carve‑outs, no data‑protection/security commitments, and impractical return/destroy wording (backups/legal holds).\n",
      "- Below I (1) list the prioritized risks and why they matter, (2) give short fixes you should adopt, and (3) provide a ready-to-use, negotiated-style confidentiality clause you can drop into the agreement (copyable). I also note next steps and a brief disclaimer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Top flagged risks (prioritized)\n",
      "1) Undefined terms and scope (Risk: high)\n",
      "- Why: Ambiguity invites conflicting interpretations and litigation.\n",
      "- Fix: Define “Confidential Information,” “Disclosing/Receiving Party,” and “termination” clearly; specify formats (written, oral, electronic, derivatives).\n",
      "\n",
      "2) No confidentiality duration or survival (Risk: high)\n",
      "- Why: Parties need certainty; trade secrets may require indefinite protection.\n",
      "- Fix: Add a fixed period (e.g., 3–5 years) and expressly preserve trade-secret protection.\n",

      "3) Missing standard carve-outs (prior possession; independent development; third‑party sources) (Risk: high)\n",
      "- Why: Without them, Receiving Party can be unfairly restricted or exposed to breach claims.\n",
      "- Fix: Add standard exclusions with proof burden for prior possession.\n",
      "\n",
      "4) No compelled‑disclosure/legal process procedure (Risk: high)\n",
      "- Why: Legal demands require a process (notify, cooperate, seek protective order).\n",
      "- Fix: Add a compelled-disclosure clause requiring prompt notice and limited disclosure.\n",
      "\n",
      "5) No permitted recipient / need-to-know carve‑out (Risk: medium–high)\n",
      "- Why: Practical business evaluation requires sharing with employees/consultants/advisors.\n",
      "- Fix: Permit disclosure to persons with need-to-know who are bound by similar obligations; make Receiving Party responsible for their breaches.\n",
      "\n",
      "6) No data-protection / privacy / security obligations (Risk: medium–high if data includes personal data)\n",
      "- Why: Personal data implicates GDPR/CCPA/etc.; technical safeguards and DPA needed.\n",
      "- Fix: Add security standard (reasonable industry-standard safeguards), breach notification timing, and require a Data Processing Addendum if personal data is involved.\n",
      "\n",
      "7) Return/destroy impracticalities (backups/legal holds) (Risk: medium)\n",
      "- Why: Instant destruction of backups may be impossible; legal holds may require retention.\n",
      "- Fix: Allow retention of archival/backups subject to confidentiality; set timeframes and certification options.\n",
      "\n",
      "8) No injunctive relief / remedies clause (Risk: medium)\n",
      "- Why: Injunctive relief is commonly required to enforce confidentiality quickly.\n",
      "- Fix: State that injunctive relief for irreparable harm is available in addition to other remedies.\n",
      "\n",
      "9) No export-control/compliance language (Risk: medium)\n",
      "- Why: “Technical data” may be export‑controlled or sanctioned.\n",
      "- Fix: Add a compliance covenant for export controls and sanctions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suggested fixes (brief)\n",
      "- Insert clear definitions and exclusions.\n",
      "- Set confidentiality duration (recommendation: 3 years for general CI; trade secrets survive).\n",

      "- Add compelled‑disclosure procedure.\n",
      "- Add return/destroy timeframe (e.g., 30 days) plus certification right; permit archival retention with restrictions.\n",
      "- Add express security/data-protection obligations and DPA trigger.\n",

      "Sample revised confidentiality clause (drop-in)\n",
      "Confidentiality\n",
      "1. Definitions. “Confidential Information” means all non‑public information disclosed by the Disclosing Party to the Receiving Party, whether disclosed orally, in writing, electronically or otherwise, that is designated as confidential or that a reasonable person would understand to be confidential given the nature of the information and the circumstances of disclosure. Confidential Information includes, without limitation, technical data, trade secrets, know‑how, inventions, business plans, financial information, forecasts, customer and supplier information, and client lists. Confidential Information does not include information that: (a) was in the Receiving Party’s lawful possession prior to disclosure as evidenced by written records; (b) is or becomes generally available to the public other than by a breach of this Agreement by the Receiving Party; (c) is received by the Receiving Party from a third party without breach of any obligation of confidentiality; or (d) is independently developed by the Receiving Party without use of or reference to the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information (each an “Exclusion”).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Use and non‑disclosure. The Receiving Party shall (a) use Confidential Information only for the sole purpose of evaluating the proposed business relationship between the parties (the “Purpose”); and (b) hold and protect the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information in strict confidence using at least the same degree of care it uses to protect its own confidential information of similar importance, but in no event less than reasonable care. The Receiving Party shall not disclose Confidential Information except as expressly permitted by this Agreement.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Permitted disclosures. The Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information to its employees, contractors, consultants, affiliates, legal counsel, accountants and advisors (“Representatives”) who have a need to know for the Purpose, provided that (a) such Representatives are informed of the confidential nature of the information and are bound by confidentiality obligations at least as restrictive as those set out herein; and (b) the Receiving Party remains responsible for any breach of this Agreement by its Representatives.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Required/legal disclosure. If the Receiving Party is required by law, regulation or a valid order of a court or governmental authority to disclose Confidential Information, the Receiving Party shall (to the extent legally permitted) promptly notify the Disclosing Party of the requirement so that the Disclosing Party may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy and shall cooperate with the Disclosing Party’s reasonable efforts to obtain such protection. Only the portion of Confidential Information that is legally required to be disclosed may be disclosed, and the Receiving Party shall use reasonable efforts to obtain confidential treatment for any disclosed portion.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Return, destruction and archival retention. Upon termination of discussions or at the Disclosing Party’s written request, the Receiving Party shall, within 30 days, return or destroy (at the Disclosing Party’s option) all Confidential Information in tangible form and all copies thereof. The Receiving Party may retain one (1) archival copy solely for compliance and business continuity purposes (including backups) provided such archival copy remains subject to the confidentiality obligations herein and is destroyed when no longer required. Within 10 days after return or destruction, the Receiving Party shall, upon request, certify in writing that it has complied with this Section. The obligations of this Section are subject to any legal or regulatory retention obligations, provided that Confidential Information retained pursuant to such obligations remains subject to the confidentiality protections in this Agreement.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Duration and survival. The Receiving Party’s obligations under this Agreement shall continue for a period of three (3) years from the date of disclosure of each item of Confidential Information, except that Confidential Information that qualifies as a trade secret under applicable law shall be protected for so long as it remains a trade secret. Sections [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8] (and any other provisions that by their nature survive) shall survive termination.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Security and data protection. The Receiving Party shall implement and maintain appropriate technical, administrative and physical safeguards to protect Confidential Information against unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction, consistent with industry standards. If Confidential Information includes personal data, the parties shall enter into a Data Processing Addendum addressing processing instructions, legal basis, cross‑border transfers, data subject rights and breach notification in accordance with applicable data protection laws. The Receiving Party shall notify the Disclosing Party without undue delay upon becoming aware of any unauthorized access to or disclosure of Confidential Information.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. Residuals. Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent the Receiving Party from using any residuals resulting from access to Confidential Information retained in the unaided memory of those of its Representatives who have had lawful access to such Confidential Information; provided, that the Receiving Party shall not use or disclose any trade secrets, nor shall it use or disclose Confidential Information that appears in tangible form or is otherwise identifiable as the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. Remedies. The Receiving Party acknowledges that unauthorized disclosure or use of Confidential Information may cause irreparable harm to the Disclosing Party for which monetary damages may be inadequate. The Disclosing Party shall be entitled to seek injunctive or other equitable relief to prevent or curtail any breach of this Agreement, in addition to any other remedies available at law or in equity.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. Compliance with laws. Each party shall comply with applicable export control, sanctions and trade laws in respect of any Confidential Information and shall not export, re‑export or transfer any item or data in violation of any applicable law or regulation.\n",
      "\n",
      "11. Governing law; litigation. [Insert governing law and dispute resolution provisions appropriate for the parties and jurisdiction.]\n",
      "\n",
      "Practical options / next steps\n",
      "- Decide which side you represent (Disclosing vs Receiving) so we can bias language (e.g., shorter term if Receiving Party, longer if Disclosing Party).\n",
      "- If personal data is involved, prepare a DPA to attach.\n",
      "- If you want, I can: (a) produce a redline against your original clause showing each change; (b) produce a shorter “Receiving-Party‑friendly” or “Disclosing-Party‑friendly” version; or (c) tailor the clause to a specific jurisdiction (state/country) including governing law and enforcement specifics.\n",
      "\n",
      "Risk notice / disclaimer\n",
      "- This review highlights typical legal risks and suggests language commonly used in commercial NDAs. It is not legal advice. Have local counsel review and finalize the language for your specific facts and governing law.\n",
      "\n",
      "Would you like a redlined version of your original text or a one-sided (Disclosing- or Receiving-friendly) finalized clause tailored to a jurisdiction?\n",

Definitions. “Confidential Information” means all non‑public information disclosed by the Disclosing Party to the Receiving Party, whether disclosed orally, in writing, electronically or otherwise, that is designated as confidential or that a reasonable person would understand to be confidential given the nature of the information and the circumstances of disclosure. Confidential Information includes, without limitation, technical data, trade secrets, know‑how, inventions, business plans, financial information, forecasts, customer and supplier information, and client lists. Confidential Information does not include information that: (a) was in the Receiving Party’s lawful possession prior to disclosure as evidenced by written records; (b) is or becomes generally available to the public other than by a breach of this Agreement by the Receiving Party; (c) is received by the Receiving Party from a third party without breach of any obligation of confidentiality; or (d) is independently developed by the Receiving Party without use of or reference to the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information (each an “Exclusion”).\\n\\n2. Use and non‑disclosure. The Receiving Party shall (a) use Confidential Information only for the sole purpose of evaluating the proposed business relationship between the parties (the “Purpose”); and (b) hold and protect the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information in strict confidence using at least the same degree of care it uses to protect its own confidential information of similar importance, but in no event less than reasonable care. The Receiving Party shall not disclose Confidential Information except as expressly permitted by this Agreement.\\n\\n3. Permitted disclosures. The Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information to its employees, contractors, consultants, affiliates, legal counsel, accountants and advisors (“Representatives”) who have a need to know for the Purpose, provided that (a) such Representatives are informed of the confidential nature of the information and are bound by confidentiality obligations at least as restrictive as those set out herein; and (b) the Receiving Party remains responsible for any breach of this Agreement by its Representatives.\\n\\n4. Required/legal disclosure. If the Receiving Party is required by law, regulation or a valid order of a court or governmental authority to disclose Confidential Information, the Receiving Party shall (to the extent legally permitted) promptly notify the Disclosing Party of the requirement so that the Disclosing Party may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy and shall cooperate with the Disclosing Party’s reasonable efforts to obtain such protection. Only the portion of Confidential Information that is legally required to be disclosed may be disclosed, and the Receiving Party shall use reasonable efforts to obtain confidential treatment for any disclosed portion.\\n\\n5. Return, destruction and archival retention. Upon termination of discussions or at the Disclosing Party’s written request, the Receiving Party shall, within 30 days, return or destroy (at the Disclosing Party’s option) all Confidential Information in tangible form and all copies thereof. The Receiving Party may retain one (1) archival copy solely for compliance and business continuity purposes (including backups) provided such archival copy remains subject to the confidentiality obligations herein and is destroyed when no longer required. Within 10 days after return or destruction, the Receiving Party shall, upon request, certify in writing that it has complied with this Section. The obligations of this Section are subject to any legal or regulatory retention obligations, provided that Confidential Information retained pursuant to such obligations remains subject to the confidentiality protections in this Agreement.\\n\\n6. Duration and survival. The Receiving Party’s obligations under this Agreement shall continue for a period of three (3) years from the date of disclosure of each item of Confidential Information, except that Confidential Information that qualifies as a trade secret under applicable law shall be protected for so long as it remains a trade secret. Sections [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8] (and any other provisions that by their nature survive) shall survive termination.\\n\\n7. Security and data protection. The Receiving Party shall implement and maintain appropriate technical, administrative and physical safeguards to protect Confidential Information against unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction, consistent with industry standards. If Confidential Information includes personal data, the parties shall enter into a Data Processing Addendum addressing processing instructions, legal basis, cross‑border transfers, data subject rights and breach notification in accordance with applicable data protection laws. The Receiving Party shall notify the Disclosing Party without undue delay upon becoming aware of any unauthorized access to or disclosure of Confidential Information.\\n\\n8. Residuals. Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent the Receiving Party from using any residuals resulting from access to Confidential Information retained in the unaided memory of those of its Representatives who have had lawful access to such Confidential Information; provided, that the Receiving Party shall not use or disclose any trade secrets, nor shall it use or disclose Confidential Information that appears in tangible form or is otherwise identifiable as the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information.\\n\\n9. Remedies. The Receiving Party acknowledges that unauthorized disclosure or use of Confidential Information may cause irreparable harm to the Disclosing Party for which monetary damages may be inadequate. The Disclosing Party shall be entitled to seek injunctive or other equitable relief to prevent or curtail any breach of this Agreement, in addition to any other remedies available at law or in equity.\\n\\n10. Compliance with laws. Each party shall comply with applicable export control, sanctions and trade laws in respect of any Confidential Information and shall not export, re‑export or transfer any item or data in violation of any applicable law or regulation.\\n\\n11. Governing law; litigation. [Insert governing law and dispute resolution provisions appropriate for the parties and jurisdiction.]\\n\\nPractical options / next steps\\n- Decide which side you represent (Disclosing vs Receiving) so we can bias language (e.g., shorter term if Receiving Party, longer if Disclosing Party).\\n- If personal data is involved, prepare a DPA to attach.\\n- If you want, I can: (a) produce a redline against your original clause showing each change; (b) produce a shorter “Receiving-Party‑friendly” or “Disclosing-Party‑friendly” version; or (c) tailor the clause to a specific jurisdiction (state/country) including governing law and enforcement specifics.\\n\\nRisk notice / disclaimer\\n- This review highlights typical legal risks and suggests language commonly used in commercial NDAs. It is not legal advice. Have local counsel review and finalize the language for your specific facts and governing law.\\n\\nWould you like a redlined version of your original text or a one-sided (Disclosing- or Receiving-friendly) finalized clause tailored to a jurisdiction?',\n",

Provide for certification of destruction where practical.\\n\\n7) No certification or audit right for destruction (Risk: low-medium)\\n- Problem: Disclosing Party has no mechanism to verify destruction.\\n- Why: May limit confidence in compliance.\\n- Fix: Allow Disclosing Party to request certification of destruction within a defined timeframe; optionally permit limited audits.\\n\\n8) No security, data-protection, or privacy controls (Risk: medium-high if data is personal)\\n- Problem: No obligations for technical or organizational measures or data processing terms.\\n- Why: If confidential includes personal data, laws like GDPR, CCPA require specific protections and DPA terms.\\n- Fix: Add security obligations (e.g., reasonable industry-standard safeguards), data processing and breach notification provisions, and require compliance with applicable privacy laws.\\n\\n9) Export control and regulatory compliance not addressed (Risk: medium)\\n- Problem: “Technical data” may be subject to export controls or sanctions.\\n- Why: Non-compliance can cause criminal/regulatory penalties.\\n- Fix: Add compliance covenant for export controls and sanctions laws; require parties to identify restricted data up front.\\n\\n10) No remedies / injunctive relief clause (Risk: medium)\\n- Problem: No statement that injunctive relief may be sought for breach.\\n- Why: Confidentiality breaches often require urgent injunctive relief; absence may hinder enforcement.\\n- Fix: Include a provision that monetary damages are inadequate and injunctive relief is available.\\n\\n11) No limitation of liability / indemnity language (Risk: medium)\\n- Problem: No allocation of liability for breaches or misuse.\\n- Why: Parties may want caps or indemnities; absent these, uncertainty remains.\\n- Fix: Add appropriate indemnity and limitation-of-liability clauses as negotiated.\\n\\n12) Potential personal data / privacy issues (Risk: medium-high)\\n- Problem: Client lists could contain personal data; no DPA, processor/ controller allocation, lawful basis, or cross-border transfer rules.\\n- Why: Data privacy laws require specific obligations and rights for data subjects.\\n- Fix: Add a Data Processing Agreement or privacy-specific clauses: purpose limitation, legal basis, data subject rights, breach notification timelines, data transfers, and security measures.\\n\\n13) Lack of timeframes and procedures for return/destroy (Risk: low-medium)\\n- Problem: No timeframe for when return/destruction must occur after termination; no mechanism for certification.\\n- Why: Creates disagreement over compliance timing.\\n- Fix: Specify a reasonable period (e.g., within 30 days of termination) and allow certification.\\n\\n14) Residuals / “memory” carve-out not addressed (Risk: low-medium)\\n- Problem: No residuals clause to permit use of information retained in unaided memory.\\n- Why: Without it, employees may be unfairly restricted in later roles.\\n- Fix: Add a residuals clause carefully limited to unaided memory, not copying documents or deliberate retention.\\n\\nPractical suggested language snippets (short, can be adapted by counsel)\\n- Definitions: “Confidential Information means non-public information disclosed… expressly designated as confidential or which a reasonable person would understand to be confidential… excludes information that: (a) was known to Receiving Party prior to disclosure (with written evidence); (b) is or becomes public without breach…; (c) is received lawfully from a third party; (d) is independently developed without use of Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information.”\\n- Duration: “Confidentiality obligations shall continue for [three (3) years] from the date of disclosure, except that trade secrets shall be protected for as long as they qualify as trade secrets under applicable law.”\\n- Permitted disclosures: “Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information to its employees, affiliates, legal and financial advisors and contractors on a need-to-know basis, provided such persons are bound by obligations at least as protective as this Agreement.”\\n- Compelled disclosure: “If Receiving Party is required by law to disclose Confidential Information, it shall promptly notify Disclosing Party and cooperate to seek a protective order; only disclose that portion legally required.”\\n- Return/destruction: “Within 30 days of termination, Receiving Party shall return or destroy Confidential Information and, upon Disclosing Party’s request, certify in writing the destruction. Archival backup copies may be retained only as required by business continuity or legal obligations and shall remain subject to confidentiality.”\\n- Data protection: “If Confidential Information includes personal data, parties shall enter into a Data Processing Addendum and comply with applicable data protection laws; Receiving Party shall implement appropriate technical and organizational measures.”\\n- Injunctive relief: “Breach of confidentiality may cause irreparable harm; Disclosing Party is entitled to injunctive relief in addition to other remedies.”\\n\\nActionable next steps\\n- Decide which side you represent (Disclosing or Receiving) so language can be tailored to protect that party.\\n- Add the missing clauses above to the agreement. For personal data or cross-border transfers, include a DPA.\\n- Have counsel review and finalize the wording and any jurisdiction-specific requirements (this is not legal advice).\\n\\nIf you’d like, I can:\\n- Produce a redlined version of the clause incorporating the fixes above, or\\n- Generate full clause text tailored for either Disclosing Party or Receiving Party.',\n",

Definitions. “Confidential Information” means all non‑public information disclosed by the Disclosing Party to the Receiving Party, whether disclosed orally, in writing, electronically or otherwise, that is designated as confidential or that a reasonable person would understand to be confidential given the nature of the information and the circumstances of disclosure. Confidential Information includes, without limitation, technical data, trade secrets, know‑how, inventions, business plans, financial information, forecasts, customer and supplier information, and client lists. Confidential Information does not include information that: (a) was in the Receiving Party’s lawful possession prior to disclosure as evidenced by written records; (b) is or becomes generally available to the public other than by a breach of this Agreement by the Receiving Party; (c) is received by the Receiving Party from a third party without breach of any obligation of confidentiality; or (d) is independently developed by the Receiving Party without use of or reference to the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information (each an “Exclusion”).\\n\\n2. Use and non‑disclosure. The Receiving Party shall (a) use Confidential Information only for the sole purpose of evaluating the proposed business relationship between the parties (the “Purpose”); and (b) hold and protect the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information in strict confidence using at least the same degree of care it uses to protect its own confidential information of similar importance, but in no event less than reasonable care. The Receiving Party shall not disclose Confidential Information except as expressly permitted by this Agreement.\\n\\n3. Permitted disclosures. The Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information to its employees, contractors, consultants, affiliates, legal counsel, accountants and advisors (“Representatives”) who have a need to know for the Purpose, provided that (a) such Representatives are informed of the confidential nature of the information and are bound by confidentiality obligations at least as restrictive as those set out herein; and (b) the Receiving Party remains responsible for any breach of this Agreement by its Representatives.\\n\\n4. Required/legal disclosure. If the Receiving Party is required by law, regulation or a valid order of a court or governmental authority to disclose Confidential Information, the Receiving Party shall (to the extent legally permitted) promptly notify the Disclosing Party of the requirement so that the Disclosing Party may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy and shall cooperate with the Disclosing Party’s reasonable efforts to obtain such protection. Only the portion of Confidential Information that is legally required to be disclosed may be disclosed, and the Receiving Party shall use reasonable efforts to obtain confidential treatment for any disclosed portion.\\n\\n5. Return, destruction and archival retention. Upon termination of discussions or at the Disclosing Party’s written request, the Receiving Party shall, within 30 days, return or destroy (at the Disclosing Party’s option) all Confidential Information in tangible form and all copies thereof. The Receiving Party may retain one (1) archival copy solely for compliance and business continuity purposes (including backups) provided such archival copy remains subject to the confidentiality obligations herein and is destroyed when no longer required. Within 10 days after return or destruction, the Receiving Party shall, upon request, certify in writing that it has complied with this Section. The obligations of this Section are subject to any legal or regulatory retention obligations, provided that Confidential Information retained pursuant to such obligations remains subject to the confidentiality protections in this Agreement.\\n\\n6. Duration and survival. The Receiving Party’s obligations under this Agreement shall continue for a period of three (3) years from the date of disclosure of each item of Confidential Information, except that Confidential Information that qualifies as a trade secret under applicable law shall be protected for so long as it remains a trade secret. Sections [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8] (and any other provisions that by their nature survive) shall survive termination.\\n\\n7. Security and data protection. The Receiving Party shall implement and maintain appropriate technical, administrative and physical safeguards to protect Confidential Information against unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction, consistent with industry standards. If Confidential Information includes personal data, the parties shall enter into a Data Processing Addendum addressing processing instructions, legal basis, cross‑border transfers, data subject rights and breach notification in accordance with applicable data protection laws. The Receiving Party shall notify the Disclosing Party without undue delay upon becoming aware of any unauthorized access to or disclosure of Confidential Information.\\n\\n8. Residuals. Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent the Receiving Party from using any residuals resulting from access to Confidential Information retained in the unaided memory of those of its Representatives who have had lawful access to such Confidential Information; provided, that the Receiving Party shall not use or disclose any trade secrets, nor shall it use or disclose Confidential Information that appears in tangible form or is otherwise identifiable as the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information.\\n\\n9. Remedies. The Receiving Party acknowledges that unauthorized disclosure or use of Confidential Information may cause irreparable harm to the Disclosing Party for which monetary damages may be inadequate. The Disclosing Party shall be entitled to seek injunctive or other equitable relief to prevent or curtail any breach of this Agreement, in addition to any other remedies available at law or in equity.\\n\\n10. Compliance with laws. Each party shall comply with applicable export control, sanctions and trade laws in respect of any Confidential Information and shall not export, re‑export or transfer any item or data in violation of any applicable law or regulation.\\n\\n11. Governing law; litigation. [Insert governing law and dispute resolution provisions appropriate for the parties and jurisdiction.]\\n\\nPractical options / next steps\\n- Decide which side you represent (Disclosing vs Receiving) so we can bias language (e.g., shorter term if Receiving Party, longer if Disclosing Party).\\n- If personal data is involved, prepare a DPA to attach.\\n- If you want, I can: (a) produce a redline against your original clause showing each change; (b) produce a shorter “Receiving-Party‑friendly” or “Disclosing-Party‑friendly” version; or (c) tailor the clause to a specific jurisdiction (state/country) including governing law and enforcement specifics.\\n\\nRisk notice / disclaimer\\n- This review highlights typical legal risks and suggests language commonly used in commercial NDAs. It is not legal advice. Have local counsel review and finalize the language for your specific facts and governing law.\\n\\nWould you like a redlined version of your original text or a one-sided (Disclosing- or Receiving-friendly) finalized clause tailored to a jurisdiction?',\n",
