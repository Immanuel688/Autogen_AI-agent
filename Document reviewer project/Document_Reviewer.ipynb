       "\"No harmful or unsafe content detected. Below are legal risks, ambiguities, and missing protections in the clause you provided, plus practical suggestions and short model wording to address each issue.\\n\\nMajor risks / missing items (with why it matters)\\n1. Undefined terms\\n   - “Non-public information”, “strictly confidential”, and “termination of discussions” are vague. Ambiguity creates disputes over scope and enforcement.\\n   - Suggestion: add clear definitions and examples.\\n\\n2. Too-narrow exceptions\\n   - Clause only excepts “publicly known” information. Common, reasonable exceptions are missing (already known, rightfully obtained from third party, independently developed, compelled disclosure).\\n   - Why: Without these, Receiving Party may be unfairly constrained or exposed to liability.\\n\\n3. No duration or survival provision\\n   - No timeframe for confidentiality obligations (or carve-out for trade secrets). This creates uncertainty and potential enforceability issues.\\n   - Suggestion: specify a fixed term (e.g., 3–5 years) and unlimited survival for trade secrets where appropriate.\\n\\n4. Return/destroy procedure vague\\n   - No timing, no requirement for certification of destruction, no treatment of electronic backups.\\n   - Why: Without procedure, practical compliance and auditability are difficult.\\n\\n5. No permitted disclosures to advisors/affiliates\\n   - Receiving Party often needs to share with employees, advisors or affiliates; the clause is silent.\\n   - Why: Without a controlled carve-out, normal business evaluation is blocked or becomes a breach risk.\\n\\n6. No security/data-protection obligations\\n   - If information includes personal data (client lists), there are regulatory/data breach risks (GDPR, CCPA, etc.). No reference to reasonable safeguards or compliance is a gap.\\n\\n7. No “compelled disclosure” / notice procedure\\n   - If Receiving Party is required by law to disclose, there's no requirement to notify Disclosing Party and cooperate to seek protection.\\n\\n8. No IP ownership / license language\\n   - Clause doesn’t clarify whether disclosure grants any license or transfers rights. Unclear ownership/licensing risks.\\n\\n9. No remedies, injunctive relief, or limitation of liability\\n   - Absence of remedies clauses may weaken enforcement or leave parties uncertain about available relief.\\n\\n10. No governing law, jurisdiction, or dispute resolution\\n    - Important for enforcement predictability.\\n\\n11. Oral disclosures not covered\\n    - If oral disclosures occur, the clause should require written confirmation of confidential status within a set period.\\n\\n12. “Client lists” are sensitive\\n    - Client lists may be trade secrets and/or personal data; treat accordingly (stronger protection, minimum necessary access, data processing controls).\\n\\nRecommended language snippets (concise, drop-in options)\\n\\n1) Definitions (short)\\n   - “Confidential Information” means all non-public, proprietary or business information disclosed by Disclosing Party, whether oral, written or electronic, and includes, without limitation, technical data, business plans, customer and client lists, pricing, and trade secrets. Confidential Information excludes information that (a) was already known to Receiving Party without restriction; (b) is or becomes public other than by Receiving Party’s breach; (c) is rightfully received from a third party without confidentiality obligations; or (d) is independently developed without use of Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information.\\n\\n2) Permitted recipients / responsibility\\n   - Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information only to its employees, officers, advisors, affiliates or contractors who have a strict need to know and who are bound to maintain the same obligations. Receiving Party remains responsible for any breach by such persons.\\n\\n3) Use limitation\\n   - Receiving Party shall use Confidential Information solely to evaluate and negotiate the proposed business relationship and shall not commercialize or otherwise exploit it. No license or other rights are granted except as expressly set forth in writing.\\n\\n4) Duration and survival\\n   - Confidentiality obligations survive for a period of [three (3) / five (5)] years from disclosure, except that trade secrets remain protected for as long as they qualify as trade secret under applicable law.\\n\\n5) Return / destruction\\n   - Upon termination of discussions or upon Disclosing Party’s written request, Receiving Party shall, within [30] days, return or destroy all Confidential Information (including copies and electronic versions) and certify in writing that it has done so. Reasonable archival copies stored in automatic backup systems may be retained solely to comply with legal obligations and shall remain subject to this Agreement.\\n\\n6) Compelled disclosure\\n   - If Receiving Party is legally compelled to disclose Confidential Information, it will (to the extent legally permitted) promptly notify Disclosing Party and cooperate in seeking a protective order or other remedy. Disclosure will be limited to the minimum required and, where possible, only after Disclosing Party has had an opportunity to seek protection.\\n\\n7) Security / data protection\\n   - Receiving Party will implement reasonable administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect Confidential Information and will comply with applicable data protection laws when Confidential Information contains personal data.\\n\\n8) Ownership and no license\\n   - All Confidential Information and related intellectual property rights remain the property of Disclosing Party. No rights or licenses are granted except for the limited evaluation purpose.\\n\\n9) Remedies and injunctive relief\\n   - Receiving Party acknowledges that monetary damages may be inadequate and that Disclosing Party may be entitled to injunctive or equitable relief in addition to other remedies.\\n\\n10) Governing law/dispute resolution\\n   - Add a clause specifying governing law and forum, e.g., “This Agreement is governed by the laws of [State/Country]. Any dispute shall be resolved in the courts of [jurisdiction]” (or choose arbitration).\\n\\nPractical questions to consider / next steps\\n- Do you want a fixed confidentiality term (e.g., 3–5 years) or indefinite protection for all materials?\\n- Will client lists include personal data requiring data processing terms or a DPA?\\n- Should affiliates, investors and advisors be permitted recipients? Any need for express exclusions (e.g., competitors)?\\n- Any specific jurisdiction or governing law preference?\\n\\nIf you want, I can:\\n- Produce a redlined NDA clause replacing your original with these fixes, or\\n- Create a short standalone NDA template incorporating the recommended language, tailored to a particular jurisdiction or confidentiality term.\""

       "'Below are the legal-risk and compliance issues I flagged in the clause you provided, with brief explanations and practical recommendations to reduce each risk.\\n\\nKey risks and recommended fixes\\n\\n1. Undefined scope of “non‑public information” / “confidential materials”\\n- Risk: Ambiguous scope can lead to disputes over whether particular items are covered.\\n- Fix: Define “Confidential Information” (examples, categories) and expressly list exclusions (see next item).\\n\\n2. Missing common exclusions (prior knowledge, independent development, third‑party disclosure)\\n- Risk: Recipient could be unfairly held liable for using information it already knew or independently developed.\\n- Fix: Add exclusions for information: (a) known to Recipient prior to disclosure; (b) independently developed without use of Confidential Information; (c) rightfully received from a third party without confidentiality obligation; (d) publicly known other than by Recipient’s breach.\\n\\n3. No duration specified for confidentiality\\n- Risk: Indefinite obligations may be unenforceable in some jurisdictions; uncertainty for business planning.\\n- Fix: State a definite term (e.g., 3–5 years) except that trade secrets remain protected for as long as they qualify as trade secrets.\\n\\n4. No compelled‑disclosure / court order clause\\n- Risk: Recipient might be penalized for complying with legal process or for failing to notify Discloser.\\n- Fix: Add a provision allowing compelled disclosure with prior notice to Discloser, a reasonable opportunity to seek protective order, and requirement to disclose only what is legally required.\\n\\n5. No standard of care for safeguarding information\\n- Risk: Unclear what level of protection is required; disputes over negligence standard.\\n- Fix: Require Recipient to protect Confidential Information with at least the same degree of care it uses for its own similar information, but no less than reasonable care.\\n\\n6. Return/destroy obligations lack detail (timeline, certification, backups, exceptions)\\n- Risk: Unclear timing; contested compliance; problems with retained backups or legal retention obligations.\\n- Fix: Specify a deadline for return/destruction (e.g., within 30 days of termination), require written certification of destruction, and permit retention of archival backups subject to confidentiality and deletion when feasible and to legal retention exceptions.\\n\\n7. No carve‑out for residuals or memory\\n- Risk: Ambiguity about whether Recipient can use general knowledge retained in unaided memory (useful if employees later work in similar fields).\\n- Fix: Clarify whether residuals (general skills/ideas retained in memory) are permitted and under what constraints (commonly permitted in a limited form).\\n\\n8. Affiliates, employees, contractors, advisors not addressed\\n- Risk: Recipient might disclose to its personnel/contractors without obligation to bind them, increasing leak risk.\\n- Fix: Permit disclosure only to those with a need to know and require Recipient to obligate them to equivalent confidentiality obligations and remain liable for their breaches.\\n\\n9. No data protection/personal data provisions\\n- Risk: “Client lists” may contain personal data subject to laws (GDPR, CCPA). No obligations for processing, security, cross‑border transfer, breach notification.\\n- Fix: Add data protection clauses: specify lawful purpose, security obligations, breach notification timeframe, and compliance with applicable data protection laws.\\n\\n10. No remedies, injunctive relief, or limitation of liability\\n- Risk: Lack of remedy terms can hamper enforcement; however overly broad remedies clause can be problematic.\\n- Fix: Include that monetary damages may be inadequate and Discloser is entitled to injunctive or equitable relief in addition to other remedies; consider reasonable caps/limitations on liability elsewhere if parties want them.\\n\\n11. No governing law, jurisdiction, or dispute resolution\\n- Risk: Disputes may be costly and uncertain without an agreed forum and law.\\n- Fix: Specify governing law, jurisdiction or arbitration process, and venue.\\n\\n12. No ownership or warranty disclaimers\\n- Risk: Recipient may claim ownership of derived materials or rely on inaccurate information.\\n- Fix: State that Discloser retains ownership of Confidential Information and disclaim warranties regarding accuracy; allow Recipient to rely only at its own risk unless otherwise agreed.\\n\\n13. “Without prior written consent” and “termination of discussions” ambiguous\\n- Risk: Unclear who can consent and when discussions are “terminated,” creating procedural disputes.\\n- Fix: Specify who can give consent (e.g., authorized signatory) and define when discussions terminate (e.g., written notice or after X days of inactivity).\\n\\n14. Potential unenforceability for over‑broad clauses\\n- Risk: Very broad or indefinite restrictions (especially on general use of information or client lists) can be struck down by courts.\\n- Fix: Narrow scope, add time limits, and tie restrictions to legitimate business interest (protect trade secrets, commercial value).\\n\\n15. No audit/verification or breach notification obligation\\n- Risk: Discloser has no way to confirm compliance or be promptly informed of breaches.\\n- Fix: Require prompt notification of any unauthorized disclosure and cooperation to mitigate, and consider limited audit rights if necessary.\\n\\nSummary recommendation\\n- Revise the clause to add definitions, exclusions, term, standard of care, compelled‑disclosure procedure, affiliate/recipient controls, data protection/breach rules, return/destruction mechanics (with certification), ownership/warranty language, remedies, and governing law. Where appropriate, narrow scope and add objective time limits to improve enforceability.\\n- Have the revised agreement reviewed by counsel (data protection counsel if personal data is involved) to align with applicable law and your business needs.\\n\\nIf you want, I can produce a redlined version of this clause incorporating the recommended language (with standard draft text for each fix).'"
