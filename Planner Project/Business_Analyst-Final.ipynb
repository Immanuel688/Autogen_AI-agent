      "- LTV: approximate method: LTV per employee ≈ (annual ARPU) / churn rate.\n",
      "  - Example: ARPU $10 PEPM → $120/year; churn 20% → LTV ≈ $600/employee.\n",
      "  - For 1,000‑employee account: ARR $120k; LTV ≈ $600k; if CAC = $8k, LTV:CAC = 75 (very healthy).\n",
      "- CAC payback: target <12 months for efficient growth.\n",
      "- Break‑even: expect 18–30 months from launch with pilot-led sales and disciplined CAC.\n",
      "- Startup runway: seed to early commercial ~$1.5–4M for 12–24 months to reach ARR threshold (depends on burn, hiring and pilot cadence).\n",

      "- Data breach / compliance failure: mitigate with SOC2/HIPAA, BAAs, encryption, pen testing, insurance.\n",
      "- Clinical quality risk: recruit experienced clinical leadership, clinical governance, outcomes monitoring, credential verification.\n",
      "- Competitive pressure: differentiate on enterprise integrations, privacy, measurable ROI and pilot success stories.\n",
      "- Regulatory changes: maintain legal function, monitor telehealth licensing, use local partners for non‑US geographies.\n",
      "\n",
      "11) Implementation timeline (high‑level milestones)\n",
      "- 0–3 months: form core team (CEO/CMO/CTO), select cloud/telehealth vendors, legal/compliance setup (BAAs), build MVP (basic platform, SSO, telehealth).\n",
      "- 3–6 months: onboard clinical network, launch first pilot(s), HRIS minimal integration, collect baseline metrics, SOC2 readiness.\n",
      "- 6–12 months: iterate product, close pilot conversions, expand sales & CS team, add advanced reporting, pursue SOC2 audit.\n",
      "- 12–24 months: scale enterprise sales, expand geographies (legal/clinical licensing), add on‑site services, pursue Series A.\n",
      "\n",
