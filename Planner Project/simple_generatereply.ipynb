Prepare investor materials: 36‑month financial model, sensitivity cases, cap table, go‑to‑market deck and hiring plan.\\n5. Begin seed raise of $1.2M and apply for pilot grants to fund clinical validation.\\n\\nDeliverables to prepare for investors / board\\n- Executive summary & investor pitch deck\\n- 36‑month monthly financial model with sensitivity cases\\n- Cap table and dilution scenarios\\n- Detailed hiring and milestone plan\\n- Technical architecture diagram and compliance roadmap\\n- Pilot protocol and statistical analysis plan\\n- Risk register with mitigation plan\\n\\nConclusion\\nThis combined plan lays out a clear go‑to‑market, technical, clinical validation and funding path to move from MVP to scalable launch within 12–18 months and to achieve a ~ $4.2M revenue run rate in Year 3 under base assumptions. Immediate priorities are hiring the core clinical and engineering team, locking pilot partners, building the MVP with compliant architecture, and closing the $1.2M seed to fund pilots and early commercialization. I can convert this into a 36‑month financial model, a slide deck for investors, or a detailed MVP technical spec—which would you like next?'"
